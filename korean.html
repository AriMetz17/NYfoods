 	<p>It is an incredible Korean style BBQ restaurant. They have a wonderful service that 
		waiters help you grill the meat and you just enjoy the time and be ready to eat. 
		My favorite orders are beef steak and pork belly. The meat is extremely tender 
		and juicy, as well as extremely fresh. The pieces of steak are well marbled and 
		thickly cut so when grilled it was the perfect bite. The pork belly is equally as 
		amazing as the beef. Moreover, there is also some amazing already cooked food, such 
		as seafood pancake, and kimchi soup. Their seafood pancake is tender and includes many 
		fresh seafoods in it. Lastly, if you are planning to go there for dinner, you better 
		to be there early, because there is always a long line around 1-1.5 hours for waiting.
