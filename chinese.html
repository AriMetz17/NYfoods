 <h1> THE Most Delicious Food!    <i>Chinese Cuisine!</i></h1>
  <p>  Chinese cuisine is very diversed. It is not limited to dumpling or fried rice.
 When you enter the world of Chinese food, you will experience totally different 
	 taste when the food are from different parts of the country.
	</p >
	<p>Dumplings, which is probably the food you are most familiar with, is mostly from the 
	northern part of the country, however, in the southern part of the country there are also 
	dumplings as well, except that nthey are not the ones you usually see. The flavor of Chinese food range
	from extreme sweet to extreme spicy, extreme sweetness to extreme bitterness, it all depends on 
	which part of the country you are in.

 	<p>Spicy World is a very traditional Sichuanese hotpot, however it also comebines 
		mordern element which can be appealing to young people. For example, while keeping the traditional taste, 
		Spicy World makes the hotpot soup into the shape of tidy bear.

 	 <h2><font color="pink">Daxi</f></h2>
 	<img src="daxi.jpetyle="width:330px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;">
 	 <p>This restaurant is a bar counter, not a kitchen counter—so instead of having 
 	 a gaggle of diligent chefs beavering away in front of you, you’ll be faced with what for some is the far more appealing sight of 
 	  seductively illuminated bottles of Japanese whisky and cut-glass tumblers. As
 	   soon as you’ve been served the house cocktail of the day, the kaiseki-style meal 
 	   commences. This cuisine is nominally Japanese but Chef Sam Clonts' cooking is u
 	   nfettered by tradition and puts all his experience reaped at the illustrious 
 	   Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare to good use. The most striking element here is that 
 	   these dishes are burnished with a roll-call of exceptionally luxurious ingredients
 	   , as might be evidenced by the golden Osetra caviar in the temaki, or the
 	    A5 Miyazaki rib-eye couched in the Hokkaido milk bread. The kitchen's largesse
 	     will leave a lasting impression.<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3023.
