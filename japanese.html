 <h1> One of the Most Delicious Food!<i>Japanese Cuisine!</i></h1>
 <h2> Not only Sushi</h2>
 <h3> Much More Than You Can Think</h3>
  <p>  Japan is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean,
   it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian continent and stretches from 
   the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea in
    the south.
	</p >
	<p> Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, 
	which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes. 
	The traditional cuisine of Japan (和食 washoku) is based on rice with miso soup and 
	other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often 
	consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood 
	is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood 
	and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, 
	staples include noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes 
	such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in sukiyaki and nikujaga.

	<h3>Here are some restaurants that we recommend!</h3>
	<h2><font color="pink">Ichiran Ramen</font></h2>
	<img src="images/ichiran.jpg" alt="Ichiran" style="width:330px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;">
 	<p>ICHIRAN is the birthplace of an authentic tasting tonkotsu broth that does 
 	not contain the usual strong aroma.ICHIRAN'S all-natural tonkotsu soup is extracted
 	 from 100% pork bones. Boiling pork bones for soup normally produces a strong-smelling 
 	 broth, however, the advanced technology and extraction methods of our expert artisans 
 	 remove the strong aroma. Their expertise has created a savory tonkotsu soup that both 
 	 smells and tastes delicious

 	 <h2><font color="pink">Uchū</font></h2>
 	 <img src="images/uchu.jpg" alt="Uchu" style="width:330px;height:250px;margin-left:15px;">
 	 <p>This restaurant is a bar counter, not a kitchen counter—so instead of having 
 	 a gaggle of diligent chefs beavering away in front of you, you’ll be faced with what for some is the far more appealing sight of 
 	  seductively illuminated bottles of Japanese whisky and cut-glass tumblers. As
 	   soon as you’ve been served the house cocktail of the day, the kaiseki-style meal 
 	   commences. This cuisine is nominally Japanese but Chef Sam Clonts' cooking is u
 	   nfettered by tradition and puts all his experience reaped at the illustrious 
 	   Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare to good use. The most striking element here is that 
 	   these dishes are burnished with a roll-call of exceptionally luxurious ingredients
 	   , as might be evidenced by the golden Osetra caviar in the temaki, or the
 	    A5 Miyazaki rib-eye couched in the Hokkaido milk bread. The kitchen's largesse
 	     will leave a lasting impression.<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3023.
